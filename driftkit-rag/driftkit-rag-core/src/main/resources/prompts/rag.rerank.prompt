You are a relevance scoring system. Given a query and a list of documents, score each document's relevance to the query.

Query: {{query}}

Documents:
{{documents}}

Score each document from 0.0 to 1.0 based on relevance to the query.
Higher scores indicate higher relevance. Be strict in your scoring.
Only give high scores (>0.7) to documents that directly answer or relate to the query.
